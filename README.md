# Titanic EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using the version provided by **Seaborn**. The goal is to understand the structure, relationships, and patterns within the dataset and to prepare it for future modeling tasks such as classification.
